Tasks
-----

~ Isolate machine specific code.
~ Better dump syscall to print system informations.
  Accepts a parameter with the things to dump.

Fix
---

- SIGINT to a process waiting for input that will never arrive.

To reproduce:

1. Create a pipe
2. Fork
3. Parent sleep for N seconds
4. Child waits for input on the other side
5. CTRL-C before parent wakeup.

The parent is killed by the SIGINT.
The child is waked up by the SIGINT.
The child returns to sleep "forever" (becomes an init child)

Also... Change the process group.


Missing milestones
------------------

- On-demand paging (for user stack and heap)
~ ARM port.
~ Serial driver
- TTY attributes (termios)
- Networking

Generic coding rules
--------------------

- Document code using Doxygen syntax.
- No more that 80 characters rows.
- Braces on newlines
- No typedef on structures except for the POSIX defined ones
